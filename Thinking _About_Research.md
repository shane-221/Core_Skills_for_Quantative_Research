<h1 style="text-align: center;">Thinking About Research</h1>

<h2>What Is Research?</h2>
<p>
  Research is the process we undertake when:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have a question to answer <i>(the research question)</i></li>
  <li>We need to acquire knowledge <i>(the research process)</i></li>
  <li>We want to extend our understanding of the world <i>(the research outcome)</i></li>
</ol>


<h2>What are the different types of research?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Descriptive research:</strong> Focuses on describing characteristics, patterns, or phenomena as they exist, without investigating causes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exploratory research:</strong> Conducted when little is known about a topic; aims to explore, identify patterns, and generate initial insights or hypotheses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Explanatory research:</strong> Seeks to explain why something happens, mainly through identifying and analysing causal relationships.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Evaluation research:</strong> Assesses the effectiveness, impact, or value of a program, policy, intervention, or process.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Some research questions may combine elements of more than one type.</p>


<h2>Key terms defined</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Theory: Ideas or concepts that can be used to explain and understand an event, situation, or phenomenon. This can operate at three levels:
    <ol>
      <li>Macro – grand theories that cover broad aspects of the social world</li>
      <li>Meso – mid‑level theories relating to organisations, families, communities, etc.</li>
      <li>Micro – local or small‑scale theories</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Concept: An abstract idea that describes or encapsulates a phenomenon.
  </li>

  <li>
    Paradigm: A clustering of ontological, epistemological and a theoretical position.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What Makes Good Research?</h2>
<p>Good research is characterised by the following qualities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Structure and Purpose</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides knowledge that is useful and meaningful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Rigour</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Research is carefully planned and systematically conducted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Robust and Defensible (Quality)</b>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <b>Validity and Credibility</b><br>
    Am I researching the correct phenomenon? Is the data relevant and appropriate for the research question?
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Generalisability and Transferability</b><br>
    To what extent can the findings be applied beyond the study? In which contexts are the conclusions valid?
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Systematic</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The research follows a logical and organised process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>Steps of the Research Process</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Research paradigm</h3>
<p>There are four things to be considered in this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Domain:</b>What is the domain? What constitutes subject matter?</li>
  <li><b>Reflexivity</b> – how do I relate to the world and the subject matter?</li>
  <li><b>Ontology (what exists)</b> – objects, properties, events, processes, relations etc.</li>
    There are many differnt ontological positions that exists. Here are three: 
    <ol>
      <li><b>Objectivism:</b> Social phenomena has existed for their own sake, aparat from and independent to the social actors.</li>
      <li><b>Constructivism:</b> Social phenomena are real in the sense that they are constructed ideas that are beign reviewed and reworked by those involved in them. However, the meanings and the understanding is open to study.The researcher themselves bring their own meanings to the study. </li>
      <li><b>Realism</b>-Simialr to the positivist but argues there is a part of the social reality that cannot be directly observed since its hidden.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Epistemology</b> – How do we come to know?</li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Positivism</b>- Stems from the objectivist position. There is a social reality to be studied that is independent from the researcher and the research subjects. This type of research includes quantative data to be collected, reality is measured, causal relationships are sought. </li>
    <li><b>Interpretivism</b>-Connected to the idea of Constructivism. Nature of the social phenomena is studied relative to the subjects. This prioritises peoples subjective interpretations.Knowlegge of meansings and understandings and meanings are considered. Enabling of differnt perspectives to be explored. Usually qualitatively rich, meanings and understandings to be considered. </li>  
    <li><b>Realism</b>-Reality exists outside of the researcher and this can be studied objectively similar to natural sciences. But the social reality is underpinned by invisibel but powerful structures or mechanisms.Therefore,the main goal of the realist is to identify the hidden mechanismms and the observabel effects. Coudl collect quantative or qualitative data, uncover power relations, and research that leads to action.   </li>
