<h1>Thinking About Research</h1>

<h2>What Is Research?</h2>
<p>Research is the process we undertake when:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We have a question to answer <i>(the research question)</i></li>
  <li>We need to acquire knowledge <i>(the research process)</i></li>
  <li>We want to extend our understanding of the world <i>(the research outcome)</i></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Research?</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Descriptive research:</b> Describes characteristics, patterns, or phenomena as they exist, without investigating causes.</li>
  <li><b>Exploratory research:</b> Conducted when little is known about a topic; aims to explore, identify patterns, and generate initial insights or hypotheses.</li>
  <li><b>Explanatory research:</b> Seeks to explain why something happens, mainly through identifying and analysing causal relationships.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation research:</b> Assesses the effectiveness, impact, or value of a program, policy, intervention, or process.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Some research questions may combine elements of more than one type.</i></p>

<h2>Key Terms Defined</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Theory:</b> Ideas or concepts used to explain and understand an event, situation, or phenomenon.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Macro:</b> Grand theories covering broad aspects of the social world</li>
      <li><b>Meso:</b> Mid‑level theories relating to organisations, families, communities, etc.</li>
      <li><b>Micro:</b> Local or small‑scale theories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Concept:</b> An abstract idea that describes or encapsulates a phenomenon.</li>

  <li><b>Paradigm:</b> A clustering of ontological, epistemological, and theoretical positions.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>What Makes Good Research?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Structure and Purpose</b>
    <ul><li>Provides knowledge that is useful and meaningful</li></ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Rigour</b>
    <ul><li>Carefully planned and systematically conducted</li></ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Robust and Defensible (Quality)</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Validity and Credibility:</b> Am I researching the correct phenomenon? Is the data relevant and appropriate?</li>
      <li><b>Generalisability and Transferability:</b> To what extent can findings be applied beyond the study? In which contexts are conclusions valid?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Systematic</b>
    <ul><li>Follows a logical and organised process</li></ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Steps of the Research Process</h2>

<div align="center">
<h3>Step 1: Research Paradigm</h3>
</div>
<p><u>Four elements to consider:</u></p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Domain:</b> What is the domain? What constitutes the subject matter?</li>
  <li><b>Reflexivity:</b> How do I relate to the world and the subject matter?</li>

  <li>
    <b>Ontology (what exists):</b> Objects, properties, events, processes, relations, etc.
    <p>Common ontological positions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Objectivism:</b> Social phenomena exist independently of social actors.</li>
      <li><b>Constructivism:</b> Social phenomena are constructed and continually reworked by individuals; meanings are open to study, and the researcher brings their own interpretations.</li>
      <li><b>Realism:</b> Similar to positivism but argues that part of social reality is hidden and cannot be directly observed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Epistemology (how we come to know):</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Positivism:</b> Reality exists independently of the researcher; quantitative data; measurement and causal relationships.</li>
      <li><b>Interpretivism:</b> Focus on subjective interpretations; qualitatively rich understanding of meanings and perspectives.</li>
      <li><b>Realism:</b> Reality exists independently but is shaped by hidden structures or mechanisms; may use quantitative or qualitative data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Research Questions</h3>
</div>


<ul><h4><u>Step 2.1 Understanding the Type of Research Question</u></h4></ul>
<p>There are four types of research questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Descriptive research:</b> Describes characteristics, patterns, or phenomena as they exist.</li>
  <li><b>Exploratory research:</b> Explores unknown topics and generates initial insights.</li>
  <li><b>Explanatory research:</b> Explains why something happens through causal analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation research:</b> Assesses effectiveness or impact of programs or policies.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Some research questions may combine elements of more than one type.</i></p>
<p>Hypotheses test relationships between concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Causal:</b> A causes B</li>
  <li><b>Associative:</b> A and B are related, but the nature is unclear</li>
</ul>

<ul><h4><u></u>Step 2.2 Understanding Operational Definitions</u></h4></ul>
<p>Define key concepts clearly and consistently. Use existing definitions and pilot test them.</p>

<ul><h4><u>Step 2.3 Developing the Research Question</h4></u></h4></ul>
<p>Start broad, then refine with subsidiary questions as definitions evolve.</p>
<p><i>Mitigating sections (ethical and data considerations) to follow.</i></p>
