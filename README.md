# Core Skills for Quantitative Research

This repository tracks my ongoing development in the core skills needed for quantitative and empirical research, with a focus on applications in economics, markets, and data‑driven analysis.

It brings together structured notes, worked examples, and small projects across:
- mathematics
- economics
- research methods

The goal is to build a clear, reproducible foundation for future work in macro/quant research, research engineering, and related roles.
